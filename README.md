# net-test
Simple network performance testing using iperf3 on ubuntu.

## Test Configuration
To run tests with ```iperf3``` you will need a server instance and a client instance. These could be actual
hardware machines or virtual machines. You will also need a network connection between the server and the client.

## Installation
For installation on ubuntu, use the ```install.sh``` script which will add ```ifconfig``` and ```iperf3``` if they are not already on your system.

```$ ./install.sh```

## Running Tests
For a basic run of tests without changing any network buffers, MTU, etc., use the ```server_test.sh``` on
the server instance and ```client_test.sh``` on the client instance of ubuntu.
